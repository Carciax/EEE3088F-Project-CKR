The HAT will be used as a low power temperature sensor which can be used to log temperatures and give alerts when the temperature exceeds or goes below configurable threshold temperatures. 
The attachments will be a digital temperature sensor, a potentiometer and basic I/O (LEDs and pushbuttons). The HAT will also include additional breakout pins which users can connect additional output devices to (for temperature alerts), and which will allow connection to a device that logs temperatures. 
The device could be used in a variety of situations, including personal weather logging, home agriculture, machinery/manufacturing temperature monitoring, student research, and office monitoring. 
The potentiometer will be used for configuration of the device, such as to set threshold temperatures and change sensor frequency.
